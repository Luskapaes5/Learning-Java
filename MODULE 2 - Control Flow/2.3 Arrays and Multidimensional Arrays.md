# Module 2.3 – Arrays and Multidimensional Arrays

## Introduction

Arrays are data structures that store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They provide indexed access to elements and allow efficient storage and manipulation of ordered data.

In Java, arrays are objects with a fixed size defined at creation time. Once initialized, their length cannot be changed. Arrays are fundamental for iteration, data aggregation, and algorithm implementation.

---

## One-Dimensional Arrays

A one-dimensional array represents a linear sequence of elements. Each element is accessed using an index, starting from `0`.

### Declaration

```java
type[] arrayName;
```

Example:

```java
int[] numbers;
```

---

## Instantiation

An array must be instantiated with a defined size.

```java
numbers = new int[5];
```

This creates an array capable of storing five integers. All elements are initialized with default values (`0` for numeric types, `false` for boolean, `null` for reference types).

Declaration and instantiation can be combined:

```java
int[] numbers = new int[5];
```

---

## Initialization with Values

Arrays can be initialized directly with predefined values.

```java
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
```

The size is automatically determined by the number of elements provided.

---

## Accessing and Modifying Elements

Elements are accessed using their index.

```java
int value = numbers[0];
numbers[1] = 25;
```

Attempting to access an index outside the valid range results in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

Valid indices range from `0` to `array.length - 1`.

---

## The `length` Property

Arrays contain a built-in property called `length` that returns their size.

```java
int size = numbers.length;
```

This property is commonly used in loop conditions.

Example:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(numbers[i]);
}
```

---

## Multidimensional Arrays

A multidimensional array is an array of arrays. The most common form is the two-dimensional array, which represents tabular or matrix-like data.

### Declaration

```java
type[][] arrayName;
```

Example:

```java
int[][] matrix;
```

---

## Instantiation

```java
matrix = new int[3][4];
```

This creates a structure with 3 rows and 4 columns.

---

## Initialization with Values

```java
int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```

Each inner array represents a row.

---

## Accessing Elements in Multidimensional Arrays

Elements are accessed using two indices:

```java
int value = matrix[1][2];
```

The first index refers to the row, and the second refers to the column.

To iterate through all elements:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.println(matrix[i][j]);
    }
}
```

---

## Jagged Arrays

Java allows multidimensional arrays with rows of different lengths. These are known as jagged arrays.

Example:

```java
int[][] jagged = new int[3][];

jagged[0] = new int[2];
jagged[1] = new int[4];
jagged[2] = new int[1];
```

Each row can have a different size.

---

## Common Errors

1. Accessing an invalid index.
2. Forgetting to instantiate inner arrays in jagged structures.
3. Confusing `array.length` with method calls (it is a property, not a method).

---

## Conceptual Summary

Arrays provide indexed, fixed-size storage for homogeneous data. They enable efficient iteration and direct element access. One-dimensional arrays represent linear sequences, while multidimensional arrays model structured data such as matrices or tables. Mastery of arrays is essential for algorithm design, data processing, and understanding more advanced data structures introduced later in Java’s standard library.
