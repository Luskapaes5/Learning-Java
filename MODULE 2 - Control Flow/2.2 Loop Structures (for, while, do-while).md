# Module 2.2 – Loop Structures (for, while, do-while)

## Introduction

Loop structures enable repeated execution of a block of code while a specified condition remains satisfied. They are fundamental to iterative computation, allowing programs to process sequences of data, perform accumulation operations, and implement repetition-based algorithms.

In Java, the primary loop constructs are:

- `for`
- `while`
- `do-while`

Each loop type is suited to different iteration scenarios depending on whether the number of iterations is known in advance and when the condition must be evaluated.

---

## The `for` Loop

The `for` loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known or can be expressed through a counter variable. It centralizes initialization, condition evaluation, and update logic within a single statement.

### Syntax

```java
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // code executed on each iteration
}
```

- **Initialization**: executed once at the beginning.
- **Condition**: evaluated before each iteration.
- **Update**: executed after each iteration.

### Example

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
}
```

This loop executes five times, with `i` taking values from 0 to 4.

The `for` loop is preferred when iteration is counter-controlled and bounded.

---

## The `while` Loop

The `while` loop executes a block of code repeatedly as long as its condition evaluates to `true`. The condition is evaluated before each iteration.

### Syntax

```java
while (condition) {
    // code executed while condition is true
}
```

### Example

```java
int count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
    System.out.println("Count: " + count);
    count++;
}
```

If the condition evaluates to `false` initially, the loop body will not execute at all.

The `while` loop is appropriate when the number of iterations is not predetermined and depends on runtime conditions.

---

## The `do-while` Loop

The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the condition is evaluated after the loop body executes. As a result, the block of code is guaranteed to execute at least once.

### Syntax

```java
do {
    // code executed at least once
} while (condition);
```

### Example

```java
int number = 0;

do {
    System.out.println("Number: " + number);
    number++;
} while (number < 5);
```

Even if the condition is initially `false`, the loop body executes once before evaluation.

The `do-while` structure is suitable when at least one execution is logically required, such as menu-driven systems or input validation loops.

---

## Loop Control Statements

Java provides control statements that modify loop execution:

- `break` — immediately terminates the loop.
- `continue` — skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.

### Example Using `break`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i == 5) {
        break;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

The loop stops when `i` equals 5.

### Example Using `continue`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 2) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

The iteration where `i` equals 2 is skipped.

---

## Infinite Loops

A loop becomes infinite when its condition never evaluates to `false`. This may occur due to missing updates or logical errors.

Example:

```java
while (true) {
    System.out.println("Infinite loop");
}
```

Infinite loops are sometimes intentional (e.g., server processes), but they must include an internal termination condition to avoid uncontrolled execution.

---

## Conceptual Comparison

| Scenario | Recommended Structure |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Known number of iterations | `for` |
| Condition-based repetition | `while` |
| At least one execution required | `do-while` |

---

## Conceptual Summary

Loop structures are essential for implementing repetition in software systems. They enable iterative processing, accumulation patterns, traversal of data structures, and algorithmic control mechanisms. The selection between `for`, `while`, and `do-while` depends on the logical requirements of initialization timing, condition evaluation, and iteration predictability. Proper loop design ensures clarity, correctness, and termination guarantees in control flow.
