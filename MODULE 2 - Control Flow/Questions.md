# Module 2 – Exercises (Control Flow and Arrays)

Covers:
- 2.1 Conditional Structures
- 2.2 Loop Structures
- 2.3 Arrays and Multidimensional Arrays

---

## Part I – Conditionals

**1. Number Classification**  
Print `"Positive"`, `"Negative"`, or `"Zero"` using `if-else`.

**2. Grade Evaluation**  
Given a grade (0–100), print:
- ≥ 90 → Excellent  
- ≥ 70 → Good  
- ≥ 50 → Average  
- Otherwise → Fail  

**3. Day of the Week**  
Using `switch`, map 1–7 to weekdays. Handle invalid values.

**4. Simple Calculator**  
Given two numbers and an operator (`+ - * /`), perform the operation using `switch`. Handle division by zero.

## Part II – Loops

**5. Counting**  
Print numbers from 1 to 100 using both `for` and `while`.

**6. Sum 1 to N**  
Given `n`, compute the sum from 1 to `n`.

**7. Factorial**  
Compute `n!` using a loop.

**8. Input Validation**  
Using `do-while`, request a number between 1 and 10 until valid.

**9. Prime Check**  
Determine whether a number greater than 1 is prime.

## Part III – Arrays

**10. Array Printing**  
Create an array of 10 integers and print all elements.

**11. Maximum Value**  
Find the largest element in an array.

**12. Average Calculation**  
Compute the average of array elements.

**13. Even and Odd Count**  
Count how many elements are even and odd.

**14. Reverse Output**  
Print array elements in reverse order (without modifying it).

---

## Part IV – Multidimensional Arrays

**15. Matrix Printing**  
Create and print a 3×3 matrix.

**16. Matrix Sum**  
Compute the sum of all elements in a 2D array.

**17. Diagonal Sum**  
For an `n×n` matrix, compute the main diagonal sum.

**18. Matrix Search**  
Check whether a value exists in a 2D array.

---

## Part V – Integrative

**19. Student Grades System**
- Store 10 grades in an array.
- Compute class average.
- Print `"Class Approved"` if average ≥ 70.
- Count students with grade ≥ 50.

**20. Menu-Driven Program**
Using `do-while` and `switch`, implement:

1 – Enter numbers
2 – Show maximum
3 – Show average
4 – Exit


Program ends only when option 4 is selected.

## Objective

These exercises reinforce:
- Branching logic  
- Iteration  
- Nested control structures  
- Indexed data manipulation  

Mastery of these concepts is required before progressing to methods and object-oriented programming.
