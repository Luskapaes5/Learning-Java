# Module 2.1 – Conditional Structures (if, else, switch)

## Introduction

Conditional structures allow a program to make decisions. They control the flow of execution based on boolean expressions. In Java, the main conditional structures are `if`, `if-else`, `else if`, and `switch`. These constructs evaluate conditions and execute specific blocks of code depending on whether the condition is `true` or `false`. This mechanism introduces branching logic into a program, allowing it to react dynamically to runtime data instead of executing strictly in a linear sequence.

---

## The `if` Statement

The `if` statement executes a block of code only if a condition evaluates to `true`. If the condition is `false`, the block is skipped entirely.

### Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
    // code executed if condition is true
}
```

### Example

```java
int age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
}
```

In this example, the message is printed only if `age` is greater than or equal to 18.

---

## The `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement provides an alternative execution path. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the first block executes. Otherwise, the `else` block executes.

### Syntax

```java
if (condition) {
    // executed if true
} else {
    // executed if false
}
```

### Example

```java
int age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("You are an adult.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You are a minor.");
}
```

Only one of the two blocks will execute.

---

## The `else if` Structure

When multiple conditions must be evaluated, `else if` allows sequential checking of conditions. The program evaluates conditions from top to bottom and executes the first block whose condition is `true`. Once a match is found, the remaining conditions are ignored.

### Syntax

```java
if (condition1) {
    // block 1
} else if (condition2) {
    // block 2
} else {
    // default block
}
```

### Example

```java
int grade = 85;

if (grade >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Excellent");
} else if (grade >= 70) {
    System.out.println("Good");
} else if (grade >= 50) {
    System.out.println("Average");
} else {
    System.out.println("Fail");
}
```

The ordering of conditions is critical. More restrictive conditions should appear first.

---

## The `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement is used when comparing a single variable against multiple constant values. It is often clearer and more structured than multiple `else if` statements when evaluating fixed values.

### Syntax

```java
switch (variable) {
    case value1:
        // code
        break;
    case value2:
        // code
        break;
    default:
        // code if no case matches
}
```

### Example

```java
int day = 3;

switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

The `default` block executes if none of the cases match the variable.

---

## The `break` Statement and Fall-Through

The `break` statement prevents execution from continuing to the next case. Without `break`, Java continues executing the following case blocks even if their labels do not match. This behavior is known as fall-through.

Example without `break`:

```java
int number = 1;

switch (number) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("One");
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Two");
}
```

Output:

```
One
Two
```

In most cases, `break` should be used to avoid unintended behavior.

---

## Switch with Strings

Java allows `switch` statements to operate on `String` values.

```java
String role = "admin";

switch (role) {
    case "admin":
        System.out.println("Full access");
        break;
    case "user":
        System.out.println("Limited access");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Unknown role");
}
```

This is commonly used in menu systems and role-based logic.

---

## Boolean Expressions and Logical Operators

All conditional structures depend on boolean expressions. These expressions evaluate to either `true` or `false`.

Common logical operators:

- `&&` (AND) — true only if both conditions are true
- `||` (OR) — true if at least one condition is true
- `!` (NOT) — inverts the boolean value

Example:

```java
int age = 20;
boolean hasLicense = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
    System.out.println("You can drive.");
}
```

In this case, the message prints only if both conditions are satisfied.

---

## When to Use Each Structure

| Situation | Recommended Structure |
|------------|----------------------|
| Single condition | `if` |
| Two alternatives | `if-else` |
| Multiple range-based conditions | `else if` |
| One variable, many fixed values | `switch` |

Choosing the correct structure improves readability and maintainability.

---

## Common Mistakes

1. Forgetting `break` in a `switch` statement.
2. Using `=` instead of `==` inside conditions.
3. Omitting braces `{}` in complex logic.
4. Writing unreachable conditions due to incorrect ordering.

Incorrect ordering example:

```java
if (grade >= 50) {
    System.out.println("Pass");
} else if (grade >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Excellent"); // Never reached
}
```

Correct ordering:

```java
if (grade >= 90) {
    System.out.println("Excellent");
} else if (grade >= 50) {
    System.out.println("Pass");
}
```

The most restrictive or highest threshold should be checked first.

## Conceptual Understanding

Conditional structures are fundamental to decision-making in programming. Without them, a program executes instructions sequentially without adaptation. With conditionals, execution paths diverge based on data, enabling dynamic behavior. This concept forms the basis for validation systems, game logic, user interaction flows, authentication systems, and virtually all non-trivial software systems.
