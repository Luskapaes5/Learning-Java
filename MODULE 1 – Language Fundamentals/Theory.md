# Module 1 – Language Fundamentals


### What is Java?

- A high-level programming language. The high in this context means that it's easier to read and write than low level languages like C or Assembly. These two languages interact more directly with the hardware, making them more complex and closer to the hardware.

- Object-oriented. The code is structured around objects that make organization and optimization easier. Objects are abstract things that hold their own information and methods. These methods can be reused in different parts of the program, making the code more efficient and easier to maintain.
