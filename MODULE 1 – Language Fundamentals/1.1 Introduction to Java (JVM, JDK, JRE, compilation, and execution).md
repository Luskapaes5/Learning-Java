## 1.1 Introduction to Java (JVM, JDK, JRE, Compilation, and Execution)

Java is a high-level, object-oriented, and statically typed programming language designed to be platform-independent. Its core philosophy is *"Write Once, Run Anywhere"*, which is made possible by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### Java Architecture Overview

Unlike languages such as C or C++, Java does not compile directly into native machine code. Instead, it follows a two-step process:

1. Source code compilation
2. Runtime execution via the JVM

This architecture enables portability across operating systems.

### Compilation Process

When a Java program is written, the source code is saved in a file with the `.java` extension.

The Java compiler (`javac`), which is part of the JDK, converts the `.java` file into a `.class` file. This file contains **bytecode**, an intermediate, platform-independent representation of the program.

Example:

MyProgram.java → (javac) → MyProgram.class

Bytecode is not machine code. It is designed to be executed by the JVM.

---

### Execution Process

When the program runs:

1. The JVM loads the `.class` file.
2. The bytecode is verified for security and correctness.
3. The JVM translates the bytecode into native machine code using Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
4. The CPU executes the generated machine instructions.

This extra abstraction layer allows the same `.class` file to run on any operating system that provides a compatible JVM.

### Key Components

#### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

The JVM is responsible for:

- Executing bytecode
- Converting bytecode into machine code (via JIT)
- Managing memory (heap, stack)
- Performing garbage collection
- Providing runtime security checks

Each operating system has its own JVM implementation, but all follow the same specification. This ensures platform independence.

---

#### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

The JRE provides everything necessary to **run** Java applications. It includes:

- The JVM
- Core Java libraries
- Supporting runtime files

The JRE does not include the Java compiler (`javac`), so it cannot compile `.java` files.

---

#### JDK (Java Development Kit)

The JDK is a full development environment for Java. It includes:

- The JRE
- The Java compiler (`javac`)
- Development tools (debugger, documentation generator, etc.)

The JDK is required to write, compile, and run Java programs.

---

### Conceptual Hierarchy

    JDK
    ├── JRE
    │ ├── JVM
    │ └── Core Libraries
    └── Development Tools (javac, debugger, etc.)

### Summary

- `.java` files contain source code.
- The `javac` compiler converts source code into `.class` bytecode.
- The JVM executes bytecode by translating it into machine code.
- The JRE provides runtime support.
- The JDK provides development tools.

This architecture is the foundation of Java’s portability, security, and widespread adoption.
