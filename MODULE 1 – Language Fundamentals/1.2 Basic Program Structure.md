## 1.2 Basic Program Structure

A basic Java program follows a well-defined structure. Every standalone Java application must contain at least one class and one `main` method,
which serves as the entry point of execution.

### 1.2.1 Minimal Program Example

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

}
```

### 1.2.2 Structural Components

A Java program is composed of several fundamental elements.

#### Class Declaration

The following line declares a class:

```java
public class Main
```

- `public` is an access modifier that allows the class to be accessed from anywhere.
- `class` is the keyword used to declare a class.
- `Main` is the class name and must match the file name (`Main.java`).

In Java, all executable code must be defined inside a class.

#### Main Method (Entry Point)

The `main` method is the entry point of a standalone Java application:

```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

The JVM looks for this exact method signature when starting a program.

- `public` allows the JVM to access the method.
- `static` means the method belongs to the class rather than an instance.
- `void` indicates that the method does not return a value.
- `main` is the special method name recognized by the JVM.
- `String[] args` represents command-line arguments passed to the program.

Without this method, the JVM cannot execute the program.

#### Method Body

Inside the `main` method, we place executable statements:

```java
System.out.println("Hello, World!");
```

- `System` is a built-in class from the Java standard library.
- `out` is a static output stream.
- `println()` prints text to the console and moves to the next line.

This demonstrates method invocation and standard output.

### 1.2.3 File Naming Rule

In Java, the file name must match the name of the public class.

Example:

```
Main.java → public class Main
```

If the names do not match, compilation fails.

### 1.2.4 Compilation and Execution

To compile a Java file:

```bash
javac Main.java
```

This generates a bytecode file:

```
Main.class
```

To execute the program:

```bash
java Main
```

Important:

- Do not include `.class` when running the program.
- The JVM searches for the `main` method to begin execution.

### 1.2.5 Key Structural Rules

1. All Java code must be inside a class.
2. Every standalone program must define one `main` method.
3. Every statement must end with a semicolon (`;`).
4. Java is case-sensitive.
5. Curly braces `{}` define blocks of code.

### 1.2.6 Summary

A basic Java program consists of a class declaration, a `main` method, and executable statements within that method.
Understanding this structure is essential before studying variables, data types, and control flow.
