## 1.4 Variables and Constants

Variables and constants are fundamental elements in Java programs. They allow data to be stored, manipulated, and reused throughout execution.

A **variable** represents a named memory location whose value can change during program execution.  
A **constant** represents a named value that cannot be changed after initialization.

### 1.4.1 Variable Declaration

In Java, a variable must be declared with a specific type before it can be used.

Syntax:

```java
type variableName;
```

Example:

```java
int age;
double price;
boolean isActive;
```

The type defines:
- The kind of data stored
- The memory size
- The range of valid values

Java is a **statically typed language**, meaning the type must be known at compile time.

---

### 1.4.2 Variable Initialization

Initialization assigns a value to a variable.

```java
int age = 20;
double price = 19.99;
boolean isActive = true;
```

Variables can also be declared and initialized separately:

```java
int age;
age = 20;
```

Local variables must be initialized before use. The compiler will generate an error if they are not.

---

### 1.4.3 Naming Conventions

Java follows specific naming conventions for clarity and maintainability:

- Use **camelCase** for variables:
  ```java
  int studentAge;
  double finalPrice;
  ```
- Names must:
  - Start with a letter, `_`, or `$`
  - Not begin with a number
  - Not use reserved keywords (e.g., `int`, `class`, `public`)

Meaningful names improve readability and code quality.

### 1.4.4 Variable Scope

Scope defines where a variable can be accessed.

There are three primary scopes:

1. **Local variables** – declared inside methods; accessible only within that method.
2. **Instance variables** – declared inside a class but outside methods; belong to an object.
3. **Class variables (static)** – declared with the `static` keyword; shared among all instances.

Example:

```java
public class Example {

    static int counter;        // Class variable
    int value;                 // Instance variable

    public void method() {
        int localNumber = 10;  // Local variable
    }
}
```

---

### 1.4.5 Constants

A constant is declared using the `final` keyword. Once assigned, its value cannot be changed.

Syntax:

```java
final type CONSTANT_NAME = value;
```

Example:

```java
final double PI = 3.14159;
final int MAX_USERS = 100;
```

By convention:
- Constants use **UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES**
- They are often declared as `static final` when shared globally

Example:

```java
public static final double GRAVITY = 9.8;
```

---

### 1.4.6 Type Inference (var)

Since Java 10, the `var` keyword allows local variable type inference.

Example:

```java
var number = 10;      // inferred as int
var price = 19.99;    // inferred as double
```

Important constraints:
- `var` can only be used for local variables
- The variable must be initialized at declaration
- The inferred type cannot change later

Type inference does not make Java dynamically typed. The type is still determined at compile time.

---

### 1.4.7 Reassignment

Variables can be reassigned:

```java
int score = 10;
score = 20;  // valid
```

Constants cannot be reassigned:

```java
final int LIMIT = 5;
LIMIT = 10;  // compilation error
```

---

### Summary

- Variables store changeable data.
- Constants store immutable values using `final`.
- Java requires explicit type declaration (static typing).
- Scope determines where a variable is accessible.
- Proper naming and structure improve code clarity and maintainability.
