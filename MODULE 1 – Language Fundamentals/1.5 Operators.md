## 1.5 Operators

Operators in Java are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.  
They are fundamental for manipulating data, performing calculations, and controlling logic flow.

Java operators are divided into categories based on their function.

### 1.5.1 Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations on numeric types.

| Operator | Description        | Example        |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| `+`      | Addition           | `a + b`       |
| `-`      | Subtraction        | `a - b`       |
| `*`      | Multiplication     | `a * b`       |
| `/`      | Division           | `a / b`       |
| `%`      | Remainder (modulo) | `a % b`       |

Example:

```java
int a = 10;
int b = 3;

int sum = a + b;      // 13
int division = a / b; // 3 (integer division)
int remainder = a % b; // 1
```

Important:
- Integer division discards decimal values.
- If at least one operand is `double` or `float`, the result is floating-point.

### 1.5.2 Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to variables.

Basic assignment:

```java
int x = 10;
```

Compound assignment operators combine arithmetic with assignment:

| Operator | Equivalent To |
|----------|---------------|
| `+=`     | `x = x + y`   |
| `-=`     | `x = x - y`   |
| `*=`     | `x = x * y`   |
| `/=`     | `x = x / y`   |
| `%=`     | `x = x % y`   |

Example:

```java
int x = 5;
x += 3; // x becomes 8
```

---

### 1.5.3 Relational Operators

Relational operators compare values and return a `boolean`.

| Operator | Description         |
|----------|--------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to            |
| `!=`     | Not equal to        |
| `>`      | Greater than        |
| `<`      | Less than           |
| `>=`     | Greater or equal    |
| `<=`     | Less or equal       |

Example:

```java
int age = 18;
boolean isAdult = age >= 18; // true
```

Important:
- `==` compares values (for primitives).
- `=` is assignment, not comparison.

---

### 1.5.4 Logical Operators

Logical operators operate on boolean expressions.

| Operator | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND |
| `||`     | Logical OR  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT |

Example:

```java
int age = 20;
boolean hasLicense = true;

boolean canDrive = age >= 18 && hasLicense;
```

Short-circuit behavior:
- `&&` stops evaluation if the first condition is false.
- `||` stops evaluation if the first condition is true.

---

### 1.5.5 Increment and Decrement Operators

Used to increase or decrease numeric values by 1.

| Operator | Description |
|----------|------------|
| `++`     | Increment   |
| `--`     | Decrement   |

They can appear in two forms:

- Prefix: `++x`
- Postfix: `x++`

Example:

```java
int x = 5;

int a = ++x; // x becomes 6, then assigned (a = 6)
int b = x++; // assigned first (b = 6), then x becomes 7
```

The difference is important in expressions.

---

### 1.5.6 Unary Operators

Unary operators operate on a single operand.

Examples:

```java
int x = 5;
int negative = -x;   // -5
boolean flag = true;
boolean result = !flag; // false
```

---

### 1.5.7 Operator Precedence

When multiple operators appear in the same expression, Java follows precedence rules.

Example:

```java
int result = 5 + 3 * 2; // 11
```

Multiplication has higher precedence than addition.

To control evaluation order, use parentheses:

```java
int result = (5 + 3) * 2; // 16
```

---

### Summary

- Operators manipulate data and control logic.
- Arithmetic operators perform calculations.
- Relational and logical operators produce boolean results.
- Assignment operators store values.
- Increment and decrement operators modify values by 1.
- Operator precedence determines evaluation order.

Operators are essential for building expressions and controlling program behavior.
