# 1.3 Primitive Types

Primitive types are the most fundamental data types in Java. They store simple values directly in memory and are not objects. Primitive types are efficient in terms of performance and memory usage because they hold raw values rather than references.

Java defines eight primitive types, grouped into four categories: integer, floating-point, character, and boolean.

## 1.3.1 Integer Types

Integer types store whole numbers without decimal points.

| Type  | Size   | Range (Approximate)                  |
|-------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| byte  | 8 bits | -128 to 127                          |
| short | 16 bits| -32,768 to 32,767                    |
| int   | 32 bits| -2³¹ to 2³¹ - 1                      |
| long  | 64 bits| -2⁶³ to 2⁶³ - 1                      |

The default integer type in Java is `int`.

Example:

```java
int age = 25;
long population = 8000000000L;
```

Note: The suffix `L` is required when assigning large values to a `long`.

## 1.3.2 Floating-Point Types

Floating-point types store decimal numbers.

| Type   | Size   | Precision                |
|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| float  | 32 bits| ~6–7 decimal digits      |
| double | 64 bits| ~15–16 decimal digits    |

The default floating-point type is `double`.

Example:

```java
double price = 19.99;
float temperature = 36.5f;
```

Note: The suffix `f` is required for `float` literals.

---

## 1.3.3 Character Type

The `char` type stores a single Unicode character.

- Size: 16 bits
- Range: 0 to 65,535 (Unicode)

Example:

```java
char letter = 'A';
char symbol = '#';
```

Characters are enclosed in single quotation marks.

---

## 1.3.4 Boolean Type

The `boolean` type represents logical values.

Possible values:

- `true`
- `false`

Example:

```java
boolean isActive = true;
boolean isComplete = false;
```

Booleans are commonly used in conditional expressions.

---

## 1.3.5 Type Casting

Type casting is the process of converting one data type into another.

### Implicit Casting (Widening)

Occurs automatically when converting a smaller type into a larger type.

```java
int number = 10;
double value = number;
```

### Explicit Casting (Narrowing)

Requires manual conversion and may result in data loss.

```java
double value = 10.75;
int number = (int) value;
```

After casting, `number` will store `10`, and the decimal part is discarded.

---

## 1.3.6 Overflow and Underflow

Overflow occurs when a value exceeds the maximum capacity of a data type.

Example:

```java
int max = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
max++;
System.out.println(max);
```

This results in integer overflow, causing the value to wrap around to the minimum possible value.

Primitive types do not generate runtime errors on overflow; they wrap according to binary arithmetic rules.

---

## 1.3.7 Default Values

When declared as class-level fields, primitive types receive default values:

| Type    | Default Value |
|---------|--------------|
| byte    | 0            |
| short   | 0            |
| int     | 0            |
| long    | 0L           |
| float   | 0.0f         |
| double  | 0.0d         |
| char    | '\u0000'     |
| boolean | false        |

Local variables do not receive default values and must be initialized before use.

## 1.3.8 Summary

Primitive types store simple, raw values and form the foundation of data manipulation in Java. They are memory-efficient and fast, but they do not provide object behavior. Understanding their size, range, casting behavior, and overflow characteristics is essential for writing reliable and predictable Java programs.
