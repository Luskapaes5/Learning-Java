## 1.2 Basic Program Structure

A basic Java program follows a well-defined structure. Every standalone Java application must contain at least one class and one `main` method, which serves as the entry point of execution.

### 1.2.1 Minimal Program Example

```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

}
