## 1.3 Primitive Types

Primitive types are the most basic data types in Java. They store simple values directly in memory and are not objects. Unlike reference types, primitive types do not have methods and do not reference memory addresses of other objects.

Java defines **eight** primitive types. Each one has a fixed size and a well-defined range of values. This design ensures predictability, portability, and performance across platforms.

### 1.3.1 Integer Types

Integer types store whole numbers (without decimal points).

| Type  | Size   | Range |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `byte`  | 8 bits  | -128 to 127 |
| `short` | 16 bits | -32,768 to 32,767 |
| `int`   | 32 bits | -2³¹ to 2³¹ - 1 |
| `long`  | 64 bits | -2⁶³ to 2⁶³ - 1 |

- `int` is the most commonly used integer type.
- `long` is used when larger values are required.
- `byte` and `short` are typically used for memory optimization.

Example:

```java
int age = 20;
long population = 8000000000L;
```

The suffix `L` indicates a `long` literal.

### 1.3.2 Floating-Point Types

Floating-point types store decimal numbers.

| Type    | Size   | Precision |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `float`  | 32 bits | ~6–7 decimal digits |
| `double` | 64 bits | ~15–16 decimal digits |

- `double` is the default type for decimal values.
- `float` requires the suffix `f`.

Example:

```java
double price = 19.99;
float temperature = 36.5f;
```

Floating-point numbers follow the IEEE 754 standard and may contain rounding errors due to binary representation.

---

### 1.3.3 Character Type

The `char` type stores a single Unicode character.

- Size: 16 bits
- Range: 0 to 65,535 (Unicode values)

Example:

```java
char letter = 'A';
char symbol = '@';
```

Unlike some languages, `char` in Java supports Unicode, not just ASCII.

---

### 1.3.4 Boolean Type

The `boolean` type stores logical values:

- `true`
- `false`

Example:

```java
boolean isActive = true;
```

A `boolean` does not represent numeric values (such as 0 or 1). It is used strictly for logical conditions.

---

### 1.3.5 Memory and Performance Considerations

Primitive types:

- Store values directly
- Have fixed memory sizes
- Provide high performance
- Do not require garbage collection

Because of their simplicity, primitives are more efficient than objects when only simple values are needed.

---

### 1.3.6 Default Values

When primitive types are declared as instance variables (class attributes), Java assigns default values:

| Type | Default Value |
|------|---------------|
| `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long` | `0` |
| `float`, `double` | `0.0` |
| `char` | `'\u0000'` |
| `boolean` | `false` |

Local variables, however, must be explicitly initialized before use.

### Summary

- Java has 8 primitive types.
- They store simple values directly in memory.
- Each type has a fixed size and defined range.
- `int` and `double` are the most commonly used numeric types.
- Primitives are efficient and fundamental to program structure.
